# TEST.MLC

This is a IBM Assembler program that converts a string of uppercase characters to lowercase.

It uses IBM mainframe 370 Assembler instructions, I wanted something small to demo a program for the
Z390 Portable Mainframe Assembler and Emulator, that would fit on one page.

The only non 370, thing about it are the SUBENTRY and SUBEXIT macros.
